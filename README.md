# CelsiusConverterGUI
This is an extremely simple GUI that will convert Celsius into Fahrenheit. I used it
for fun when I needed to do conversions in my chemistry problems. You can run this application
from terminal assuming you have Java installed and your path set up:

`java CelsiusConverterGUI`

Feel free to modify it to do more conversions and what not.
